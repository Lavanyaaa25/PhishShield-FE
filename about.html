    Phishing becomes a main area of concern for security researchers because it is not difficult to create the fake website which looks so close to legitimate website.Experts can identify fake websites but not all the users can identify the fake website and such users become the victim of phishing attack.

    The website aims to develop a solution for detecting malicious websites using machine learning techniques. The solution focuses on analyzing various website to classify them as legitimate, malicious or malware websites.The process include extraction of the lexical features (like count of ‘@’ , ‘.’, ‘//’, ‘http’, suspicious words, length of top-level domain etc.) count from raw URLs, as those features will be used as input features for training the machine learning model.
